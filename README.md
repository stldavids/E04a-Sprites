# E04a-Sprites Exercise

This is an exercise to start experimenting with sprites in Python Arcade. This repository assumes that you have Python Arcade installed.

The exercise takes place across three files:


 * main3.py:

   * You will need to edit line 40 to accomplish this assignment
   * If you look on lines 25–26, you will see that the sprite location is set using the center_x and center_y attributes
   * The moose is now part of the self.animal_list, so you will need to update the element(s) of that list:
     * for a in self.animal_list:

 * main4.py—*extra credit*:
   * Find some other sprites, and make them into a collage
   * Using what you have learned in the other exercise files, draw at least ten sprites in the window
   * [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl) or [openGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org) are resources for free images
   * If you would like to make them move or react to the mouse, I will award extra points

As usual, fork and clone this repository. Edit the LICENSE and README.md, and submit the URL of your repository to Canvas.
